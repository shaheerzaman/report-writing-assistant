The emergence of tariffs as a significant topic marks the highest spike since Q3 2019 in CEO discussions. Reshoring and nearshoring also experienced notable increases, while agentic AI has become a trending subject. In contrast, topics such as generative AI and sustainability have seen a decline in mention.\\nPhilipp Wegner, Principal Analyst at IoT Analytics, provided his insights into these findings. \"The US election and potential tariffs were front and center during earnings calls in Q4 2024. While most executives emphasised that their companies are prepared for tariffs, conversations showed significant underlying concerns,\" he stated.\\nKey themes from the report indicate an upward trajectory in discussions related to tariffs, reshoring, and agentic AI. Mentions of AI have generally decreased, yet the specific topic of agentic AI has gained momentum in executive conversations.\\nDespite notable catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, flooding, and severe winter storms, the frequency of discussions surrounding sustainability has continued its downward trend. Since Q1 2022, there has been a consistent decrease in quarter-over-quarter sustainability dialogues.\\nThe report shines a light on the shifting focus areas among global business leaders amidst varying economic and policy landscapes. The trends highlighted by IoT Analytics\\' analysis underscore the adaptive nature of company strategies in response to external factors.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFollow us

Operational use cases were rising to the surface, technology was reducing barriers to entry, and general artificial intelligence was obviously right around the corner.So… did any of that happen?Well, sort of. Here at the end of 2024, some of those predictions have come out piping hot. The rest need a little more time in the oven (I’m looking at you general artificial intelligence).Here’s where leading futurist and investor Tomasz Tunguz thinks data and AI stands at the end of 2024 — plus a few predictions of my own.2025 data engineering trends incoming.# 1. We’re living in a world without reason (Tomasz)\\n\\nJust three years into our AI dystopia, we’re starting to see businesses create value in some of the areas we would expect — but not all of them. According to Tomasz, the current state of AI can be summed up in three categories.1. Prediction: AI copilots that can complete a sentence, correct code errors, etc.2. Search: tools that leverage a corpus of data to answer questions3. Reasoning: a multi-step workflow that can complete complex tasksWhile AI copilots and search have seen modest success (particularly the former) among enterprise orgs, reasoning models still appear to be lagging behind. And according to Tomasz, there’s an obvious reason for that.Model accuracy.As Tomasz explained, current models struggle to break down tasks into steps effectively unless they’ve seen a particular pattern many times before. And that’s just not the case for the bulk of the work these models could be asked to perform.“Today…if a large model were asked to produce an FP&A chart, it could do it. But if there’s some meaningful difference — for instance, we move from software billing to usage based billing — it will get lost.”So for now, it looks like its AI copilots and partially accurate search results for the win.# 2. Process > Tooling (Barr)\\n\\nA new tool is only as good as the process that supports it.As the “modern data stack” has continued to evolve over the years, data teams have sometimes found themselves in a state of perpetual tire-kicking. They would focus too heavily on the *what *of their platform without giving adequate attention to the (arguably more important) *how.*But as the enterprise landscape inches ever-closer toward production-ready AI — figuring out how to operationalize all this new tooling is becoming all the more urgent.Let’s consider the example of data quality for a moment. As the data feeding AI took center-stage in 2024, data quality took a step into the spotlight as well. Facing the real possibility of production-ready AI, enterprise data leaders don’t have time to sample from the data quality menu — a few dbt tests here, a couple point solutions there. They’re on the hook to deliver value now, and they need trusted solutions that they can onboard and deploy effectively *today*.As enterprise data leaders grapple with the near-term possibility of production-ready AI, they don’t have time to sample from the data quality menu — a few dbt tests here, a couple point solutions there. They’re already on the hook to deliver business value, and they need trusted solutions that they can onboard and deploy effectively *today*.The reality is, you could have the most sophisticated data quality platform on the market — the most advanced automations, the best copilots, the shiniest integrations — but if you can’t get your organization up and running quickly, all you’ve really got is a line item on your budget and a new tab on your desktop.Over the next 12 months, I expect data teams to lean into proven end-to-end solutions over patchwork toolkits in order to prioritize more critical challenges like data quality ownership, incident management, and long-term domain enablement.And the solution that delivers on those priorities is the solution that will win the day in AI.# 3. AI is driving ROI — but not revenue (Tomasz)\\n\\nLike any data product, GenAI’s value comes in one of two forms; reducing costs or generating revenue.On the revenue side, you might have something like AI SDRS, enrichment machines, or recommendations. According to Tomasz, these tools can generate a lot of sales pipeline… but it won’t be a healthy pipeline. So, if it’s not generating revenue, AI needs to be cutting costs — and in that regard, this budding technology has certainly found some footing.“Not many companies are closing business from it. It’s mostly cost reduction. Klarna cut two-thirds of their head count. Microsoft and ServiceNow have seen 50–75% increases in engineering productivity.”According to Tomasz, an AI use-case presents the opportunity for cost reduction if one of three criteria are met:- Repetitive jobs\\n- Challenging labor market\\n- Urgent hiring needs\\nOne example Tomasz cited of an organization that *is* driving new revenue effectively was EvenUp — a transactional legal company that automates demand letters. Organizations like EvenUp that support templated but highly specialized services could be uniquely positioned to see an outsized impact from AI in its current form.# 4. AI adoption is slower than expected — but leaders are biding their time (Tomasz)\\n\\nIn contrast to the tsunami of “AI strategies” that were being embraced a year ago, leaders today seem to have taken a unanimous step backward from the technology.“There was a wave last year when people were trying all kinds of software just to see it. Their boards were asking about their AI strategy. But now there’s been a huge amount of churn in that early wave.”While some organizations simply haven’t seen value from their early experiments, others have struggled with the rapid evolution of its underlying technology. According to Tomasz, this is one of the biggest challenges for investing in AI companies. It’s not that the technology isn’t valuable in theory — it’s that organizations haven’t figured out how to leverage it effectively in practice.Tomasz believes that the next wave of adoption will be different from the first because leaders will be more informed about what they need — and where to find it.Like the dress rehearsal before the big show, teams know what they’re looking for, they’ve worked out some of the kinks with legal and procurement — particularly data loss and prevention — and they’re primed to act when the right opportunity presents itself.The big challenge of tomorrow? “How can I find and sell the value faster?”# 5. Small data is the future of AI (Tomasz)\\n\\nThe open source versus managed debate is a tale as old as… well, something old. But when it comes to AI, that question gets a whole lot more complicated.At the enterprise level, it’s not simply a question of control or interoperability — though that can certainly play a part — it’s a question of operational cost.While Tomasz believes that the largest B2C companies will use off the shelf models, he expects B2B to trend toward their own proprietary and open-source models instead.“In B2B, you’ll see smaller models on the whole, and more open source on the whole. That’s because it’s much cheaper to run a small open source model.”But it’s not all dollars and cents. Small models also improve *performance*. Like Google, large models are designed to service a variety of use-cases. Users can ask a large model about effectively anything, so that model needs to be trained on a large enough corpus of data to deliver a relevant response. Water polo. Chinese history. French toast.Unfortunately, the more topics a model is trained on, the more likely it is to conflate multiple concepts — and the more erroneous the outputs will be over time.“You can take something like llama 2 with 8 billion parameters, fine tune it with 10,000 support tickets and it will perform much better,” says Tomasz.What’s more, ChatGPT and other managed solutions are frequently being challenged in courts over claims that their creators didn’t have legal rights to the data those models were trained on.And in many cases, that’s probably not wrong.This, in addition to cost and performance, will likely have an impact on long-term adoption of proprietary models — particulary in highly regulated industries — but the severity of that impact remains uncertain.Of course, proprietary models aren’t lying down either. Not if Sam Altman has anything to say about it. (And if Twitter has taught us anything, Sam Altman definitely has a lot to say.)Proprietary models are already aggressively cutting prices to drive demand. Models like ChatGPT have already cut prices by roughly 50% and are expecting to cut by another 50% in the next 6 months. That cost cutting could be a much needed boon for the B2C companies hoping to compete in the AI arms race.# 6. The lines are blurring for analysts and data engineers (Barr)\\n\\nWhen it comes to scaling pipeline production, there are generally two challenges that data teams will run into: analysts who don’t have enough technical experience and data engineers don’t have enough time.Sounds like a problem for AI.As we look to how data teams might evolve, there are two major developments that — I believe — could drive consolidation of engineering and analytical responsibilities in 2025:- Increased demand — as business leaders’ appetite for data and AI products grows, data teams will be on the hook to do more with less. In an effort to minimize bottlenecks, leaders will naturally empower previously specialized teams to absorb more responsibility for their pipelines — and their stakeholders.\\n- Improvements in automation — new demand always drives new innovation. (In this case, that means AI-enabled pipelines.) As technologies naturally become more automated, engineers will be empowered to do more with less, while analysts will be empowered to do more on their own.\\nThe argument is simple — as demand increases, pipeline automation will naturally evolve to meet demand. As pipeline automation evolves to meet demand, the barrier to creating and managing those pipelines will decrease. The skill gap will decrease and the ability to add new value will increase.The move toward self-serve AI-enabled pipeline management means that the most painful part of everyone’s job gets automated away — and their ability to create and demonstrate new value expands in the process. Sounds like a nice future.# 7. Synthetic data matters — but it comes at a cost (Tomasz)\\n\\nYou’ve probably seen the image of a snake eating its own tail. If you look closely, it bears a striking resemblance to contemporary AI.There are approximately 21–25 trillion tokens (words) on the internet right now. The AI models in production today have used all of them. In order for data to continue to advance, it requires an infinitely greater corpus of data to be trained on. The more data it has, the more context it has available for outputs — and the more accurate those outputs will be.So, what does an AI researcher do when they run out of training data?They make their own.As training data becomes more scarce, companies like OpenAI believe that synthetic data will be an important part of how they train their models in the future. And over the last 24 months, an entire industry has evolved to service that very vision — including companies like Tonic that generate synthetic structured data and Gretel that creates compliant data for regulated industries like finance and healthcare.But is synthetic data a long-term solution? Probably not.Synthetic data works by leveraging models to create artificial datasets that reflect what someone *might* find organically (in some alternate reality where more data actually exists), and then using that new data to train their own models. On a small scale, this actually makes a lot of sense. You know what they say about too much of a good thing…You can think of it like contextual malnutrition. Just like food, if a fresh organic data source is the most nutritious data for model training, then data that’s been distilled from existing datasets must be, by its nature, less nutrient rich than the data that came before.A little artificial flavoring is okay — but if that diet of synthetic training data continues into perpetuity without new [grass-fed data](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-monte-carlo-announces-release-of-observability-platform-for-locally-sourced-small-batch-data/) being introduced, that model will eventually fail (or at the very least, have noticeably less attractive nail beds).It’s not really a matter of if, but when.According to Tomasz, we’re a long way off from model collapse at this point. But as AI research continues to push models to their functional limits, it’s not difficult to see a world where AI reaches its functional plateau — maybe sooner than later.# 8. The unstructured data stack will emerge (Barr)\\n\\nThe idea of leveraging unstructured data in production isn’t new by any means — but in the age of AI, unstructured data has taken on a whole new role.According to a report by IDC [only about half of an organization’s unstructured data is currently being analyzed](https://www.box.com/resources/unstructured-data-paper).All that is about to change.When it comes to generative AI, enterprise success depends largely on the panoply of unstructured data that’s used to train, fine-tune, and augment it. As more organizations look to operationalize AI for enterprise use cases, enthusiasm for unstructured data — and the burgeoning “[unstructured data stack](https://www.felicis.com/insight/unstructured-data-stack)” — will continue to grow as well.Some teams are even exploring how they can [use additional LLMs to add structure to unstructured data](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-generative-ai-use-case-assurance/) to scale its usefulness in additional training and analytics use cases as well.Identifying what unstructured first-party data exists within your organization — and how you could potentially activate that data for your stakeholders — is a greenfield opportunity for data leaders looking to demonstrate the business value of their data platform (and hopefully secure some additional budget for priority initiatives along the way).If 2024 was about exploring the potential of unstructured data — 2025 will be all about realizing its value. The question is… what tools will rise to the surface?# 9. Agentic AI is great for conversation — but not deployment (Tomasz)\\n\\nIf you’re swimming anywhere near the venture capital ponds these days, you’re likely to hear a couple terms tossed around pretty regularly: “copilot” which is a fancy term for an AI used to complete a single step (“correct my terrible code”), and “agents” which are a multi-step workflow that can gather information and use it to perform a task (“write a blog about my terrible code and publish it to my WordPress”).No doubt, we’ve seen a lot of success around AI copilots in 2024, (just ask Github, Snowflake, the Microsoft paperclip, etc), but what about AI agents?While “agentic AI” has had a fun time wreaking havoc on customer support teams, it looks like that’s all it’s destined to be in the near term. While these early AI agents are an important step forward, the accuracy of these workflows is still poor.For context, 75%-90% accuracy is state of the art for AI. Most AI is equivalent to a high school student. But if you have three steps of 75–90% accuracy, your ultimate accuracy is around 50%.We’ve trained elephants to paint with better accuracy than that.Far from being a revenue driver for organizations, most AI agents would be actively harmful if released into production at their current performance. According to Tomasz, we need to solve that problem first.It’s important to be able to talk about them, no one has had any success outside of a demo. Because regardless of how much people in the Valley might love to talk about AI agents, that talk doesn’t translate into performance.# 10. Pipelines are expanding — but quality coverage isn’t (Tomasz)\\n\\n“At a dinner with a bunch of heads of AI, I asked how many people were satisfied with the quality of the outputs, and no one raised their hands. There’s a real quality challenge in getting consistent outputs.”Pipelines are expanding and they need to be monitoring them. He was talking to an end to end AI solution. Everyone wants AI in the workflows, so the pipelines will increase dramatically. The quality of that data is absolutely essential. The pipelines are massively expanding and you need to be monitoring or you’ll be making the wrong decisions. And the data volumes will be increasingly tremendous.Each year, Monte Carlo [surveys](https://resources.montecarlodata.com/ebooks/data-quality-survey?lx=LPgDLW&__hstc=100283906.b359adac67445cf6180d3f7f38ad0d78.1730402075922.1732724613875.1733184267813.16&__hssc=100283906.3.1733184267813&__hsfp=4002305717&_gl=1*4sniqo*_gcl_au*MTA1MTAwOTQ4MS4xNzEyODU1Njc5*_ga*MTU2Njg0MDg0Mi4xNzEyODU1Njc5*_ga_SZGJ8KW5Z8*MTcxOTI4MDM2NS4xNy4xLjE3MTkyODA0MTMuMTIuMC4w&_ga=2.30907576.683842243.1719280366-1566840842.1712855679) real data professionals about the state of their data quality. This year, we turned our gaze to the shadow of AI, and the message was clear.Data quality risks are evolving — but data quality management isn’t.“We’re seeing teams build out vector databases or embedding models at scale. SQLLite at scale. All of these 100 million small databases. They’re starting to be architected at the CDN layer to run all these small models. Iphones will have machine learning models. We’re going to see an explosion in the total number of pipelines but with much smaller data volumes.”The pattern of fine-tuning will create an explosion in the number of data pipelines within an organization. But the more pipelines expand, the more difficult data quality becomes.Data quality increases in direct proportion to the volume and complexity of your pipelines. The more pipelines you have (and the more complex they become), the more opportunities you’ll have for things to break — and the less likely you’ll be to find them in time.+++*What do you think?

From recruitment to customer service, agentic AI is driving productivity, while collaboration fuels its global AI leadership.******\\n\\n## The UK is positioned to lead the global agentic AI explosion\\n\\n The numbers don’t lie: the UK is outpacing its G7 peers with an AI readiness score of 65.5, well above the G7 average of 61.2. That’s a signal that Britain is poised to take the lead in the next wave of artificial intelligence innovation. The secret? A combination of practical regulation, a culture that embraces forward-thinking, and an ability to bring public and private sectors together on transformative projects. Government initiatives like the AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park are setting real benchmarks on issues like transparency and privacy. These are the foundations of any sustainable AI ecosystem. This balanced regulatory framework, coupled with a national focus on innovation, has created fertile ground for agentic AI, the kind that collaborates with humans and adapts to complex challenges in real time. What makes this exciting is the UK’s ability to look beyond AI as a tool and instead see it as a partner in reshaping industries.\\xa0 ## The UK’s private sector is driving AI adoption, especially among SMEs\\n\\n UK companies are adopting AI in a way that sets benchmarks. Scoring 52 on the readiness index, compared to a G7 average of 47.8, the UK’s private sector is showing that it’s more than ready to harness the power of AI to solve real-world problems. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are particularly noteworthy. They might lack the deep pockets of large corporations, but they’re making up for it with agility and an eagerness to integrate AI into their processes. From simplifying operations to improving customer experiences, these businesses are proving that you don’t need to be a giant to use big technology. What keeps this momentum going is the tight collaboration between the government and private entities. When aligning on objectives and pooling resources, SMEs gain access to tools and knowledge that help them compete on a global scale. In essence, this partnership is creating a win-win scenario: a thriving private sector and a nation that’s increasingly difficult to ignore in the global AI race. ## Salesforce’s investment in the UK AI ecosystem\\n\\n Big moves require big investments, and Salesforce is stepping up. With a $4 billion commitment over the next five years, Salesforce is building an extensive ecosystem. The UK AI Centre in London is already showing results, having engaged over 3,000 stakeholders through training and workshops designed to make AI accessible and actionable. One of the smartest aspects of this investment is its focus. When addressing regulatory nuances, bridging Europe’s structured frameworks with the United States’ freer model, Salesforce is navigating complexities that many would shy away from. Meanwhile, there’s a clear focus on supporting SMEs with the resources and infrastructure they need to integrate AI effectively. Perhaps the most impactful initiative is the push to build an AI workforce equipped for the future. Centralized training programs and a drive to improve digital skills are laying the foundation for a talent pool that will not only sustain but propel the UK’s AI ambitions forward. ## Agentic AI boosts business productivity across industries\\n\\n Agentic AI is delivering results that speak for themselves. Take Capita, for example. When deploying autonomous agents, the company has improved its recruitment process, slashing timelines from weeks to mere days. That’s huge when it comes to hiring at scale. Meanwhile, Secret Escapes, a company serving 60 million members across Europe, has found innovative ways to automate routine customer service tasks. Things like processing cancellations or updating booking information are no longer bottlenecks, freeing up human agents to tackle more complex challenges.\\xa0 It’s not just these two players. Heathrow, Bionic, and others are tapping into Salesforce’s Agentforce platform to optimize operations and deliver better outcomes. Whether it’s logistics, travel, or customer service, the applications are broad, and the results are consistently impressive. ## Collaboration is key to sustaining the UK’s AI leadership\\n\\n Sustained partnerships between government, academia, and industry are proving to be the glue that holds the country’s AI ambitions together. These collaborations are translating into real progress. Talent development remains a top priority. If the UK wants to maintain its edge, it needs a workforce that can meet tomorrow’s challenges head-on. Programs aimed at building digital skills and supporting innovation are helping to secure this pipeline of expertise. Regulation also plays a role, and flexible frameworks are keeping the UK competitive on the global stage. Antony Walker, Deputy CEO at techUK, nailed it when he emphasized the need for regulation that adapts without stifling progress. This mindset is what allows the UK to scale its AI sector while staying nimble enough to compete with powerhouses like the US and EU. In the end, it’s all about alignment, getting government, business, and academia rowing in the same direction. And if the UK continues to prioritize this kind of synergy, its position as a global AI leader will be all but guaranteed.Alexander ProcterDecember 17, 20244 MinTags: [Artificial

services provider support, creating a new business group and helping to launch Accenture’s AI Refinery platform for agentic AI[Shane Snider](/author/shane-snider), Senior WriterOctober 7, 20241 Min ReadNvidia/AccentureThe age of artificial intelligence working independently is upon us as two tech behemoths -- AI chip leader Nvidia and IT service giant Accenture -- on Wednesday announced a partnership that promises to bring more agentic AI to businesses.Agentic AI systems are a type of artificial intelligence that can achieve goals and make decisions without direct human supervision -- planning actions, breaking down complex tasks, analyzing sensory input, making predictions, and even interacting with other systems. The technology promises to boost productivity and control labor costs.While GenAI launched an enterprise arms race to adopt AI, agentic AI could be the technology that really transforms the enterprise. According to a report from Emergen Research, the agentic market is valued at $30.89 billion in 2024 and has an expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.68%. North America makes up about 20% of the total market.“AI will supercharge enterprises to scale innovation at great speed,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement. “Nvidia’s platform, Accenture’s AI Refinery, and our combined expertise will help businesses and nations accelerate this transformation to drive unprecedented productivity and growth.”Read the full story from AI Business' sister[ publication Information Week](https://www.informationweek.com/machine-learning-ai/nvidia-accenture-join-forces-to-boost-agentic-ai-in-enterprise) >>>Related:[Nvidia CEO: Generative AI, Accelerated Computing to Redefine the Future](/verticals/nvidia-ceo-generative-ai-accelerated-computing-to-redefine-the-future)## About the Author\\n\\n[Shane Snider](/author/shane-snider)Senior Writer, InformationWeekShane Snider is a veteran journalist with more than 20 years of industry experience.

That\\'s a bold statement that got my attention. \\n\\nGoogle has 90% market share. It\\'s been the go-to for so long that \"Google it\" has become synonymous with online search. But per Alex: 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝗴𝗿𝗶𝗽 𝗶𝘀 𝘀𝗹𝗶𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴.\\n\\nWhy? AI-powered alternatives. 🤖\\n\\nI was shocked to learn these stats:\\n- 10% of consumers now consider ChatGPT their primary search engine. \\n- Perplexity queries are growing 25-30% month-over-month. \\n\\nSo why are users converting?\\n\\n1️⃣ 𝗗𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗔𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘃𝘀. 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗸𝘀: AI search engines don\\'t just give you a list of links. They understand your query and synthesize an answer. \\n\\n2️⃣ 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱, 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: These tools can engage in back-and-forth conversations, so users can get a follow-up answer.\\n\\n3️⃣ 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀: The average query on Perplexity is 10-11 words. On Google? Just 2-3. We\\'re asking more complex questions.\\n\\n4️⃣ 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗖𝗹𝘂𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗔𝗱𝘀: For now, at least, these AI search tools offer a cleaner, ad-free experience. \\n\\nSo, what does all this mean for the future of search? As we look towards 2025, here\\'s a few key trends:\\n\\n1. Consolidation in general-purpose search\\n2. Proliferation of specialized, vertical-specific search tools\\n3. Blurring lines between consumer and enterprise search\\n4. Integration of both web and proprietary data sources\\n\\nThe way we search for and interact with information is evolving rapidly.

The camera was a primitive device by today\\'s standards, capturing black-and-white images at a resolution of 0.01 megapixels and storing them on a cassette tape.\\n\\nHowever, Kodak was heavily invested in the film business at the time, which was its primary source of revenue. Company leaders feared that digital technology would disrupt their profitable film sales. As a result, Kodak did not pursue the development of digital cameras aggressively and instead focused on protecting its film business.\\n\\nThis strategic hesitation allowed other companies like Sony, Canon, and Nikon to dominate the digital camera market when it eventually took off. Kodak later tried to catch up but struggled, eventually filing for bankruptcy in 2012. This story is often cited as a classic example of the \"innovator\\'s dilemma\"—when companies are unwilling to embrace new technology that might disrupt their core business. Corporate culture resistant to change and the silencing of innovators ultimately led the company to bankruptcy. Resistance to change often starts at the management level, making it a latent problem that can undermine an entire organization\\'s ability to adapt and survive.\\n\\nImage Source: [Cargocollective.com](http://Cargocollective.com?trk=news_storyline_guest_reshare-text)\\n\\n- \\n\\n[\\n\\n                    1\\n\\n](https://www.linkedin.com/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fdipl-ing-ahmet-tolga-tat-b280118a_will-google-become-the-next-yahoo-or-altavista-activity-7274496847522459648-Ml-6&trk=news_storyline_guest_social-actions-reactions)\\n\\n[\\n\\n      Like\\n\\n](https://www.linkedin.com/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fdipl-ing-ahmet-tolga-tat-b280118a_will-google-become-the-next-yahoo-or-altavista-activity-7274496847522459648-Ml-6&trk=news_storyline_guest_like-cta)\\n[\\n\\n      Comment\\n\\n](https://www.linkedin.com/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fdipl-ing-ahmet-tolga-tat-b280118a_will-google-become-the-next-yahoo-or-altavista-activity-7274496847522459648-Ml-6&trk=news_storyline_guest_comment-cta)\\n[\\n\\n      Share\\n\\n](https://www.linkedin.com/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fdipl-ing-ahmet-tolga-tat-b280118a_will-google-become-the-next-yahoo-or-altavista-activity-7274496847522459648-Ml-6&trk=news_storyline_guest_share-cta)\\n\\n        To view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fdipl-ing-ahmet-tolga-tat-b280118a_will-google-become-the-next-yahoo-or-altavista-activity-7274496847522459648-Ml-6&trk=news_storyline_guest_feed-cta-banner-cta)\\n\\n8. \\n\\n[\\n\\n ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikramgundeti?trk=news_storyline_guest_feed-actor-image)\\n\\n[\\n              Vikram Gundeti\\n            ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikramgundeti?trk=news_storyline_guest_feed-actor-name)\\n\\n                CTO - Foursquare, Founding Engineer - Amazon Alexa\\n\\n      1d\\n\\n- \\n[\\n\\n                      Report this post\\n\\n    ](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fvikramgundeti_chatgpt-locationintelligence-foursquareplaces-activity-7274495727521701890-HarR&trk=news_storyline_guest_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\\n\\nThrilled to announce our partnership with [OpenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai?trk=news_storyline_guest-text)!\\n\\n[Foursquare](https://www.linkedin.com/company/location-foursquare?trk=news_storyline_guest-text)\\'s Places API is now powering [ChatGPT](https://www.linkedin.com/company/generative-ai-tools-tips?trk=news_storyline_guest-text) search with real-time location data across 100M+ points of interest globally.

At ERGO, this has been reality for quite some time: All colleagues in Germany, including tied agents, already have access to “ERGO GPT”. And the rollout to other markets is in progress.\\n\\nWhen the hype about [#ChatGPT](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fchatgpt&trk=public_post-text) from [OpenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai?trk=public_post-text) broke out in late 2022, ERGO reacted quickly and set up a project to investigate and utilise the opportunities of Large Language Models ([#LLMs](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fllms&trk=public_post-text)) for our extremely data-driven industry. \\n\\nShortly after, our very own LLM, “ERGO GPT”, was running stably and has actively being used\\xa0ever since. Of course, the introduction of the new tool was – and is – accompanied by numerous training measures and offers.\\n\\nSince the latest upgrade, “ERGO GPT” runs on GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini\\xa0and features, among others, PDF uploads as well as individual configuration parameters for conversation tonality and creativity. \\n\\nAt the same time, we have ensured that our very own LLM does not allow our colleagues' entries to be saved and processed by the provider for training purposes. This enables us to process even internal and confidential data, proving that it is indeed possible to use\\xa0LLMs securely in the [#insurance](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Finsurance&trk=public_post-text) context!\\n\\n👏 Thanks to our colleagues who brought “ERGO GPT” to life, among many others: [Nicolas Konnerth](https://de.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-konnerth?trk=public_post-text), [Sebastian Holzborn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/holzborn?trk=public_post-text), [Antonia Schiller](https://de.linkedin.com/in/antonia-schiller-1525651a0?trk=public_post-text), [Mathias Bock](https://de.linkedin.com/in/mathias-bock-a579781a2?trk=public_post-text), Michal Denka, MBCS, [Michał Błoch](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/michalbloch?trk=public_post-text), [Izabela Brayson](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/izabela-brayson-95953a334?trk=public_post-text), [Pryscylla K.](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/pkurkus?trk=public_post-text)\\n\\nERGO intends to be a digital leader in the insurance industry by 2025 – both in Germany and in its core international markets.

education agreement will see students and staff able to use ChatGPT Edu and the university able to create its own secure custom AI bots, with the aim of creating “AI natives” across the campus.\\nUNSW’s chief information officer, Dr Chrissy Burns, said the deal is “a pivotal moment in our journey to integrate cutting-edge technology into the fabric of UNSW”.\\n\\n                ============\\n\\n                ============\\n\\n“By leveraging the enterprise-level capabilities of ChatGPT Edu, we can ensure our researchers, educators, and students have access to secure and advanced AI tools tailored to their needs,” Burns said in a statement.\\n“This collaboration aligns seamlessly with UNSW’s strategy to embed AI across all disciplines, driving innovation, safeguarding intellectual property, and preparing our community to thrive as AI-natives in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.”\\n\\nOpenAI’s general manager of education, Leah Belsky, said the company was “delighted” to work with UNSW on what is the first-of-its-kind agreement in the Asia-Pacific region.\\nUNSW vice-chancellor and president, Professor Attila Brungs, said the collaboration will enhance both the teaching and student experience.\\n“From engineering to health, business and science, AI is revolutionising research and education by making learning more personalised, accessible, and impactful,” Brungs said.\\n\\n[VIEW ALL](/discover)\\n\\n[\\n\\nPromoted by Dragos\\n\\nIn the crosshairs: Critical infrastructure targeted by state actors\\nREAD

months.\\nProfessor Paul Andon, senior deputy dean for education and student experience at the UNSW Business School, said the pilot was part of an “educational transformation” at the university.\\n“Through this pilot, we are exploring innovative ways to collaborate with AI to unlock new possibilities to elevate the learning experience at scale for business educators and students,” Andon said.\\n\\n### \\n\\n                        David Hollingworth                            \\n\\nDavid Hollingworth has been writing about technology for over 20 years, and has worked for a

As a result, this type of medicine proves to be effective for a range of fungi and bacterial infections. That’s because antibiotics help to inhibit the growth and spread of bacteria and kill the attacking bacteria quickly and effectively. Everyone should take great care to use a conscientious and reputable Canadian online pharmacy [https://canadianrxon.com/](https://canadianrxon.com/). To avoid trouble, it is necessary to raise public awareness, so that every potential buyer of drugs knows the signs of a rogue pharmacy and backs off before making a wrong decision.\\nHere are some tips, which should help you avoid getting tangled with a rogue pharmacy:\\nBeware of websites that offer prescription drugs and do not require a prescription from your physician: this can be dangerous;\\nOffer drugs at suspiciously low prices;\\nNot authorized by NARPA and/or other Canadian drug regulatory authorities;\\nOffer drugs that are not approved by the FDA;\\nSend spam messages;\\nLocated outside of Canada and sell worldwide;\\nDo not care to provide decent consulting services.\\n\\nHit enter to search or ESC to close \\n\\n[\\n    ](#)\\n\\n[\\n\\n](https://techblogwriter.co.uk)\\n\\n [         ](#sidewidgetarea) \\n\\n- [My Story](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/about/)\\n\\n- [Tech Talks Daily Podcast](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/podcast/)\\n\\n- [Tech Fusion Podcast With Citrix Ready](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/the-citrix-ready-podcast/)\\n\\n- [Services](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/services/)\\n\\n- [Blog](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/blog/)\\n\\n- [Events](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/event-coverage/)\\n\\n- [Contact](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/contact/)\\n\\n[Podcast](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/category/podcast/)\\n# 3121: Gen AI at Work: BCG and OpenAI’s Study on Expanding Employee Capabilities\\n\\nBy [administrator](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/author/administrator/) December 17, 2024\\n[ No Comments](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/boston-consulting-group-bcg/#respond)\\n\\nIn this episode of Tech Talks Daily, we explore groundbreaking research from the BCG Henderson Institute, revealing the profound impact of Generative AI on data science tasks within the consulting sector.\\nI am joined by Vladimir “Vlad” Lukic from Boston Consulting Group (BCG), who shares insights from a recent collaborative study with Boston University and OpenAI’s Economic Impacts team.\\nThe experiment tested the efficacy of GenAI tools, including Enterprise ChatGPT with GPT-4 and Advanced Data Analysis, in enhancing the productivity and technical capabilities of BCG consultants versus traditional methods.\\n\\nVlad details the experimental setup where consultants undertook typical data science tasks such as writing Python code for cleaning datasets, constructing predictive models, and validating statistical analyses generated by ChatGPT. The performance metrics of 480 consultants were then measured against 44 seasoned BCG data scientists who completed the tasks without GenAI assistance.\\nKey findings underscored by Vlad reveal that GenAI not only elevates performance but also equips personnel with sophisticated technical skills, albeit tied to the use of the tool itself. Remarkably, consultants with no prior coding experience were able to execute advanced tasks, achieving 86% of the benchmark established by data scientists and completing these tasks with a 10% faster average time.\\nI also learn how BCG is harnessing GenAI to foster productivity and broaden skill sets internally. Vlad explores the broader implications of GenAI in revolutionizing the consulting and professional services industries, driving significant value for clients through AI integration.\\nKey takeaways from this session include the transformative role of GenAI as an ‘exoskeleton’ that offers instant skill augmentation, the necessity of balancing this with sustainable skill development, and the critical insights into effective GenAI integration within professional workflows.\\nJoin us as we explore these dynamic changes, offering both a comprehensive overview of the practical applications of GenAI and a visionary outlook on its evolving role in the professional world.\\n**Useful Links**\\n\\n- \\n\\nConnect with [Vladimir Lukic on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-lukic-/)\\n[Learn more about BCG](https://www.bcg.com/about/people/experts/vladimir-lukic)\\n[Follow on LinkedIn,](https://www.linkedin.com/company/boston-consulting-group/) [Twitter](https://x.com/BCG), [Instagram,](https://www.instagram.com/bcg/?hl=en) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BostonConsultingGroup)\\n\\n**Subscribe to the Tech Talks Daily Podcast**\\n\\n### Share this:\\n\\n- [Twitter](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/boston-consulting-group-bcg/?share=twitter&nb=1)\\n- [Facebook](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/boston-consulting-group-bcg/?share=facebook&nb=1)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/boston-consulting-group-bcg/?share=linkedin&nb=1)\\n- [Reddit](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/boston-consulting-group-bcg/?share=reddit&nb=1)\\n- [Telegram](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/boston-consulting-group-bcg/?share=telegram&nb=1)\\n- [WhatsApp](https://techblogwriter.co.uk/boston-consulting-group-bcg/?share=jetpack-whatsapp&nb=1)\\n- \\n### Like this:\\n\\nLike Loading...\\n\\n### \\nadministrator \\n\\nSearch\\n#### Work With Neil\\n\\n#### Check Out My Best-Selling Book\\n\\n- ### Previous Post3122: How Panasonic Connect Is Empowering Mission-Critical Workforces with AI\\n\\n- ### Next Post3120: Real-Time Response: The Tech Revolutionizing Policing\\n\\n### Leave a Reply Cancel Reply\\n\\n Name * \\nEmail *\\nWebsite\\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\\n\\nΔ \\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

services provider support, creating a new business group and helping to launch Accenture’s AI Refinery platform for agentic AI[Shane Snider](/author/shane-snider), Senior WriterOctober 7, 20241 Min ReadNvidia/AccentureThe age of artificial intelligence working independently is upon us as two tech behemoths -- AI chip leader Nvidia and IT service giant Accenture -- on Wednesday announced a partnership that promises to bring more agentic AI to businesses.Agentic AI systems are a type of artificial intelligence that can achieve goals and make decisions without direct human supervision -- planning actions, breaking down complex tasks, analyzing sensory input, making predictions, and even interacting with other systems. The technology promises to boost productivity and control labor costs.While GenAI launched an enterprise arms race to adopt AI, agentic AI could be the technology that really transforms the enterprise. According to a report from Emergen Research, the agentic market is valued at $30.89 billion in 2024 and has an expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.68%. North America makes up about 20% of the total market.“AI will supercharge enterprises to scale innovation at great speed,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement. “Nvidia’s platform, Accenture’s AI Refinery, and our combined expertise will help businesses and nations accelerate this transformation to drive unprecedented productivity and growth.”Read the full story from AI Business' sister[ publication Information Week](https://www.informationweek.com/machine-learning-ai/nvidia-accenture-join-forces-to-boost-agentic-ai-in-enterprise) >>>Related:[Nvidia CEO: Generative AI, Accelerated Computing to Redefine the Future](/verticals/nvidia-ceo-generative-ai-accelerated-computing-to-redefine-the-future)## About the Author\\n\\n[Shane Snider](/author/shane-snider)Senior Writer, InformationWeekShane Snider is a veteran journalist with more than 20 years of industry experience.

As companies struggle with implementation, attention is turning to how AI will reshape workplaces in 2025 and beyond.\\nAccording to Liz Centoni, Chief Customer Experience Officer at Ciscom enterprise technology faces changes from autonomous AI and [quantum computing](https://technologymagazine.com/top10/top-10-quantum-computing-companies) security threats in 2025.\\nThe company’s analysis highlights shifts in how AI systems will operate without human intervention, alongside emerging cybersecurity risks as quantum computers begin to threaten existing encryption methods.\\n## Autonomous AI agents reshape enterprise operations at Cisco\\n\\nA key development will be the emergence of [agentic AI](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/how-agentic-ai-is-impacting-global-enterprise-automation) – autonomous AI systems that can learn continuously from user data and make decisions independently, rather than following static rules. These systems will coordinate with each other to handle complex business processes like supply chain management.Cisco highlights shifts in how AI systems will operate without human intervention“In 2025, AI won’t just be a tool; it will be a collaborator,” Liz predicts. “Unlike today’s approaches that require user prompts or predefined rules, agentic AI will operate proactively.”\\nThe systems will predict user needs before queries are made and resolve network issues autonomously. Multiple AI agents will work together to manage supply chains by forecasting demand, optimising inventories and coordinating deliveries.\\n“For businesses, this shift means a leap in efficiency and [personalisation](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/intuit-how-ai-driven-personalisation-is-reshaping-ecommerce),” she says. “It also underscores the importance of governance and guardrails. In response to the rise of Agentic AI, we will see organisations implementing mandatory ethical guidelines to ensure fairness and transparency in algorithmic decisions and protecting intellectual property.”\\n## Humanoid robots enter workforce as infrastructure challenges emerge\\n\\nThe first deployments of [humanoid robots](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/nvidia-the-rise-of-ai-humanoid-robots) working alongside humans will likely occur in 2025, requiring enterprises to upgrade their network infrastructure. Companies will need low-latency connectivity to support real-time data processing for these systems.Key facts- 40% of network outages are caused by configuration errors, costing firms 9% of annual revenue\\n- Only 13% of organisations are prepared to leverage AI technologies to their full potential\\n- By 2025, AI data centres will consume as much energy as the Netherlands annually\\n“Companies will need to ensure their connectivity has the right levels of latency and throughput, because the humanoids’ performance will be driven by their ability to process and analyse data in real time,” says Liz.\\nSecurity poses another infrastructure challenge. Networks must protect both the data processed by humanoid systems and prevent tampering with their control software.\\nImplementation of AI continues to face obstacles, with Cisco’s AI Readiness Index showing global preparedness has declined one point over the past year. Only 13% of organisations report readiness to fully utilise AI technologies.\\nComputing power remains a constraint, with 21% of organisations having sufficient graphics processing units for current and future AI workloads.\\n“Many boards will find themselves readjusting expectations, timelines and priorities that were established mere months ago as companies reckon with the ‘messy middle’ of AI implementation,” Liz notes.\\n## Security threats evolve with quantum computing\\n\\nCybersecurity will also face fresh challenges from quantum computing advances that could break current encryption methods. This comes as AI enables new attack types like prompt injection, where malicious code masquerades as legitimate AI system inputs.\\nOnly 30% of companies globally report capabilities to address AI-specific security threats, according to Cisco’s research.The increasing connectivity of digital systems adds complexity to the security landscape. “As things become increasingly connected, the sophistication of attacks grows too,” says Liz. “The network’s ability to provide visibility into the environment will make it the first and last line of defence.”\\nNetwork configuration errors, which cause 40% of outages and cost businesses 9% of annual revenue, may reduce as [AI automation](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/how-agentic-ai-is-impacting-global-enterprise-automation) increases. AI-driven tools will learn from each configuration to prevent errors and maintain continuous operations.\\n“As attackers shift their tactics to compromise users and endpoints, aiming for lateral movement to maximise the impact of their attacks, the network will become a crucial pillar of security. The network’s ability to provide visibility into the environment will make it the first and last line of defence. We will see organisations integrating AI to augment human capabilities to fortify the network as a pivotal line of defence and policy enforcement.”\\n## Sustainability concerns rise with AI adoption\\n\\nThe environmental impact of AI deployment presents sustainability challenges. Data centres dedicated to AI are projected to consume as much energy as the Netherlands by 2025.\\nAI could help address these issues through energy networking, combining software-defined networking with direct current micro grids to monitor emissions and optimise power usage.Many boards will find themselves readjusting expectations, timelines and priorities that were established mere months agoLiz Centoni, Chief Customer Experience Officer, Cisco“Businesses that win will be those who prioritise energy-efficient products and circularity in business models,” says Liz. “AI will be both the ‘what’ and the ‘how’ in this space, bringing us vast capabilities and a continuous learning method for delivering them more sustainably.\\n“2025 marks a pivotal moment in our technological journey where AI, cybersecurity, data governance and sustainability converge to redefine the business environment. Embracing these trends with strategic foresight and pragmatism will empower companies to navigate challenges and seize opportunities for growth and excellence. The technology trends at play in 2025 will redefine the interplay between technology and humanity. So let’s embrace the future with optimism and work to shape a world where technology and humanity thrive in harmony – for good.”\\n\\n*Explore the latest edition of *[Technology Magazine](https://technologymagazine.com/magazines)* and be part of the conversation at our global conference series, *[Tech & AI LIVE](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)**.**\\n*Discover all our *[upcoming events](https://live.technologymagazine.com/)* and secure your tickets today.*\\n\\n*Technology Magazine*** ***is a *[BizClik](https://www.bizclikmedia.com/)* brand *[technology](/search?q=technology)[Ai](/search?q=Ai)[Cisco](/search?q=Cisco)[quantum](/search?q=quantum)ShareCompanies[Cisco Systems](/company/cisco-systems)[Latest### Digital Magazine\\n\\nRead Now ](/magazine/technology-magazine-december-2024)RelatedContent- [Databricks Valuation Hits US$62bn After Latest VC RoundData & Data Analytics](/articles/databricks-valuation-hits-us-62bn-after-latest-vc-round)\\n- [How Kyndryl Partnership Drives WPP Workplace TransformationCloud & Cybersecurity](/articles/how-kyndryl-partnership-drives-wpp-workplace-transformation)\\n- [How Apple & United are Transforming Airport Baggage TrackingDigital Transformation](/articles/how-apple-united-are-transforming-airport-baggage-tracking)\\n- [Dell SVP Forecasts AI PC Surge as Data Centre Demands ShiftAI & Machine Learning](/articles/dell-svp-forecasts-ai-pc-surge-as-data-centre-demands-shift)\\n## Featured Articles\\n\\n### How Kyndryl Partnership Drives WPP Workplace Transformation\\n\\nGlobal infrastructure providerKyndryl has overhauled creativeagency WPP’s technologysystems with AI-powered man……### How Google’s Gemini 2.0 AI Will Uplift Universal Assistance\\n\\nGoogle\\'s latest LLM, Gemini 2.0,introduces advancedmultimodal capabilities, agenticAI abilities and enhanced perfo……### Google Cloud Agentspace to Connect Enterprise Data with AI\\n\\nGoogle’s new platformcombines Gemini AI withenterprise search capabilities,allowing companies to build c……### How Apple & United are Transforming Airport Baggage Tracking\\n\\nDigital Transformation### Dell SVP Forecasts AI PC Surge as Data Centre Demands Shift\\n\\nAI & Machine Learning### Apple Announces Latest Saudi Arabia Tech Sector Expansion\\n\\nDigital Transformation- [SAP: AI & Data Key to Closing COP29 Climate Commitments Gap](/articles/sap-ai-data-key-to-closing-cop29-climate-commitments-gap)\\n- [PwC and AWS Forge Path for Regulated AI Adoption](/articles/pwc-and-aws-join-forces-on-enterprise-ai-controls-system)\\n- [Nvidia Predictions: AI Infrastructure Set to Shift in 2025](/articles/nvidia-predictions-ai-infrastructure-set-to-shift-in-2025)\\n- [Nvidia & AWS’s AI Breakthroughs at Re:Invent 2024](/articles/nvidia-awss-ai-breakthroughs-at-re-invent-2024)\\n- [SAP and AWS Partner on AI-Powered Cloud ERP Platform GROW](/articles/sap-and-aws-partner-on-ai-powered-cloud-erp-platform-grow)\\nTechnology Magazine is the ‘Digital Community’ for the global technology industry.

If you’re an engineer, startup founder, or businessperson interested in the potential of AI agents, check it out!*If the AI agent race was a poker game, the latter half of 2024 would consist of one tech giant after another looking at the table and saying “all in”.With Google’s launch of Gemini 2.0 last week [leaning heavily on agentic AI and coming accompanied by a plethora of new agents](https://www.buildingaiagents.ai/p/gemini-2-google-new-agents?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents), nearly every Big Tech company — and many of the prominent large language model (LLM) startups — have now made significant investments in AI agents.As [labor costs represent the majority](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/human-capital/us-cons-laborwise-core-data-sheet.pdf?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents) of most companies’ spending, the most immediately valuable use that many see for agentic technology is reducing the number of human hours worked. Consequently, most of the leading technology companies have launched their own enterprise agent platforms, which provide agents as a service to save workers time — or replace them entirely. [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents), released in 2023 to take advantage of OpenAI’s cutting-edge models, has now evolved into [Copilot Agents](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/introducing-copilot-agents-943e563d-602d-40fa-bdd1-dbc83f582466?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents), which integrate into the Microsoft 365 enterprise suite. The company is currently locked in a fierce competition with Salesforce, which has arguably gone further than any of its rivals in centering its entire business around agents with its [Agentforce](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents) platform. Meanwhile, after testing the waters with [Vertex AI Agent Builder](https://cloud.google.com/products/agent-builder?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents), Google launched its own contender for the enterprise AI crown with [Agentspace](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/bringing-ai-agents-to-enterprises-with-google-agentspace?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents) just last Friday. Amazon and IBM, though less assertive than their competitors so far, provide [Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents) and [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/ai-agent-development?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents), respectively, allowing customers to build agentic applications and integrate them with their systems.Most of these platforms are low-code/no-code, providing high-level, abstracted interfaces, and all are proprietary, preventing agent builders from freely using them outside of their providers’ walled gardens, or remixing them into new software with modified capabilities. Alone among the tech giants, Microsoft has also made an open-source play with its [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents) multi-agent framework, recently forked into [AG2](https://ag2.ai/?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents) by several members of its founding team who departed the company. OpenAI has released its own open-source option, [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents), but it is intended as an experimental educational tool rather than for full production.Though the agent contest within Big Tech has been in full swing for the better part of a year now, the past several months have seen the rapid rise of a particularly powerful subtype: [multimodal computer use agents](https://www.buildingaiagents.ai/p/vision-agents-take-off?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents). While most AI agents interact with the world purely through text, there is growing interest in endowing them with the ability to directly control computers via graphical user interfaces as humans do, bringing them closer to the Holy Grail of fully autonomous workers. Anthropic kicked off the recent sprint for preeminence in visual agents with its [Computer Use announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents) in October, followed quickly by a (possibly intentional) leak from OpenAI that it would release a similar system in January called [Operator](https://www.buildingaiagents.ai/p/openai-giant-breakthrough-coming-january?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents). Not to be outdone, Google responded last week with [Project Mariner](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/google-unveils-project-mariner-ai-agents-to-use-the-web-for-you/?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents), which leverages the company’s ubiquitous Chrome browser.The only large tech companies not to have made significant public announcements of agentic capabilities are Meta and Apple, though with the former [launching a business-to-business AI team](https://www.buildingaiagents.ai/p/meta-joins-business-agent-race?utm_source=www.buildingaiagents.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=big-tech-is-now-all-in-on-agents) and the latter’s new push into AI with Apple Intelligence, this may soon change. Elon Musk’s xAI, which has rapidly grown to prominence with its increasingly capable Grok models, remains a significant wild card as well.2024 will be remembered as the year in which the tech world bet big on AI agents, with trillions of dollars in enterprise value potentially on the line. In 2025, we may find out who will go home with the pot, and the stakes could not be higher.*If you found this piece valuable, check out *[Building AI Agents](https://www.buildingaiagents.ai/subscribe)* to get free updates on the rapidly-growing field of AI agents!*## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\\n\\n## Free\\n\\nDistraction-free reading.

It doesn’t matter if you want to streamline your workflows or have someone to have real-time collaboration with, if you have a need, there will be an agent.”“Agentic AI will be the rage,” **Patrick Kelley, Distinguished Architect at Zoom**, added. “Taking AI beyond just generating the content, that’s so 2024!”“Vendors will start unveiling AI that actually does mundane tasks for you. For example, you’re in a chat channel with 10 people, and somebody says, ‘We need a meeting to discuss all this stuff.’ Instead of checking people’s calendars to find a time and creating an agenda, an agentic AI bot will be able to summarise the chat topic, find an open slot for everyone, create the agenda, and send out the meeting, saving me countless minutes doing all this manually.”Sterner also believes that Copilot Agents will also be more formally integrated across Microsoft Teams as another boost to collaboration. “There will be Microsoft Teams agents or just a simple way of creating them for Teams to use on Teams, to use them for narrowing down the answers we’re getting from AI, which would be a chef’s kiss!” Sterner expanded.**Jon Arnold, Principal Analyst at J Arnold & Associates**, also highlights the approach of agentic AI: “All the collaboration platforms are now basically moving towards having this capability where we each have our own personalised assistant that can handle tasks end-to-end without human intervention. It’s like having a personal secretary to do all of your day-to-day workflow items automatically.”“This gives us more time to do our more human-centric tasks. I think you’ll see it big time in the contact centre, for sure, this AI agent concept, but you’re going to see more of it being central to the UC value proposition in 2025.”## The RTO Debate Coming To A Head\\n\\nThe return-to-office (RTO) debate is more vocal than ever. Massive businesses like Amazon and Dell are mandating full-time returns to the office, while prominent surveys indicate that flexible working has overtaken pay as the most important issue for many workers. Could 2025 see even more dramatic twists in this subject?“I want to go back to the concept of where we’re going to work,” said **Craig Durr, Chief Analyst and Founder at The Collab Collective**. “I’m going to drop a number to really hammer home this idea. $1 trillion. That’s the amount of debt coming due in commercial real estate in the US market in the next 12-24 months. That’s about 20 percent of commercial real estate debt being refreshed at this point in time.”What does this mean?“To me, that means hybrid work, distributed work, modern work, whatever words you want to use is not going away,” Durr expanded. “Now, here’s the interesting twist that’s going with that. A lot of that debt is going to be hitting the small-to-midsize banking industry, and they typically serve small to midsize enterprises.”“In the past year, we’ve heard a lot about how enterprises are driving the idea of commercial real estate and what’s coming back into the office or not. Amazon is making mandates, and other people are changing their tune. I think this is really going to hit home in the small to midsize enterprise in the next 20-24 months.”“We’re currently sitting at 20-25 percent of companies working or having some remote work in the US, and I think that number is going to stay solid, and if not, potentially increase going into 2025.”How does Durr expect this to impact tech leaders?“If you are an IT decision-maker within a small-to-midsize space, I expect that if you haven’t already confronted the idea of how we’re going to work and use our corporate real estate going forward, 2025 and 2026 are going to be your years,” he said. “You’re going to have a lot of pressure from your board about your real estate strategy, and you’re going to have to start thinking about ‘How are we going to implement hybrid or distributed work?'”“It’s not going to be anything new, but I think you’ll see a lot of companies who haven’t committed to that yet will have to confront it.”\\n\\n## Growing Integration Between UC, CC And CRM Platforms\\n\\nThe fusion of UC, contact centre, CRM and back office technology as one unified management experience continues to build as a way of the future, as illustrated by the increasingly diversified portfolios of vendors like Zoom, Cisco Webex, Mitel and 8×8.“I think we’re going to see a lot more integration between UC systems and the underlying business management or CRM systems,” said **Mike Wilkinson, Chief Product and Marketing Officer at Akixi**. “That’s going to help improve customer experience.”**Paul Holden, VP of Sales, EMEA, at CallTower**, also highlights this emerging trend: “2025 will be the year of the connected world where organisations will connect their back office into their contact centre.”“Back office, whether they’re on Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex or Zoom, utilising the PBX functionality built within those platforms creating a seamless network, connecting into their contact centre so they can have both a great employee experience, and also create a fantastic customer experience. Everybody connected, one seamless platform.”As businesses prioritise seamless workflows, the capacity to enable real-time data sharing across tools will be game-changing. As Wilkinson and Holden attest, this convergence enhances CX, bolsters productivity, and supports AI-driven insights for personalised, efficient comms and collaboration strategies.## AI’s Focus Evolving Into Tangible Use Cases\\n\\nA sister prediction to the rise of agentic AI is the assertion that AI is going to evolve its focus onto more tangible, specific use cases.“I think we’re going to see a lot more discovery around AI-based use cases,” Wilkinson said. “Many will fail, a few will definitely succeed, and we’re going to see more and more monetisation around that.”“I think AI is peaking and will come in many different forms, whether it’s AI for voice technology, AI in camera intelligence, and really, AI in terms of data integration and insights,” suggested **Sandhya Rao, Group Product Manager at Microsoft Teams**. “There’ll be a lot more AI even beyond what Copilot can do.”**Melody Brue, VP & Principal Tech Analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy**, also stressed the prediction of more personalised AI.“I think AI will drive a wave of hyper-personalisation, aligning with the growing demand for a tailored experience. We saw this in HP’s Work Relationship Index. People really want a more personalised work experience, and I think we’ll see this show up in customised interfaces and adapted virtual assistants, like AI-powered assistants that will learn from user preferences.“Also, I think intelligent message suggestions, so more context-aware prompts that will guide users to more effective communications. I think we’ll find that AI will empower knowledge workers to connect and collaborate in ways that best suit their individual needs and preferences.”**Josh Blalock, Chief Video Evangelist at Jabra**, agrees but highlights that integral to this change will require greater focus on adoption and education around AI’s use cases: “I think we’re at a point with AI where people are aware that it’s there, but the coming year is where all the adoption efforts are going to have to really take root in order for the value of AI to start getting recognised on a larger, more massive scale.”“When we think about collaboration, we think about how AI is being used in the workplace, I think we’re going to see a new resurgence of content, of focus, of efforts, of engagement that are about learning to adapt to what we’ve been announcing for the last year through different platform providers.**Brad Hintze, EVP of Global Marketing at Crestron**, pointed out the expectation that AI’s impact on our work lives will change expectations of meeting spaces. “I think multicamera, I think intelligent audio, all of those capabilities will become very important in all kinds of different meeting room sizes, I think this is going to be a really big wave that people might not be thinking about right now as we’re obsessed with all of the personal productivity related to AI, but we will see it, I think, middle and late next year.”\\n- [2025 UC Predictions – UC Round Table](https://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/2025-uc-predictions-uc-round-table/)\\n\\n- [UC Predictions for 2024 Reviewed: Hits and Misses](https://www.uctoday.com/event-news/uc-predictions-for-2024-reviewed-hits-and-misses/)\\n\\n[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uctoday.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/)[Chatbots](https://www.uctoday.com/tag/chatbots/)[Customer Experience](https://www.uctoday.com/tag/customer-experience/)[Digital Transformation](https://www.uctoday.com/tag/digital-transformation/)[Microsoft Teams](https://www.uctoday.com/tag/microsoft-teams/)[UCaaS](https://www.uctoday.com/tag/ucaas/)[Video Conferencing](https://www.uctoday.com/tag/video-conferencing/)[Workplace Management](https://www.uctoday.com/tag/workplace-management/) \\n\\n### Brands mentioned in this article.\\n\\n[Microsoft](https://www.uctoday.com/vendor/microsoft/) \\n\\nFeatured\\n\\n[\\n\\nUnified Communications\\n\\n                How AI-Powered Meeting Insights are Shaping the Future of Organizational Productivity            \\n\\n](https://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/how-ai-powered-meeting-insights-are-shaping-the-future-of-organizational-productivity-audiocodes/)\\n\\n[\\n\\nUnified Communications\\n\\n                Cloud Hosted PBX: How to Maximize the Managed Service Provider Opportunity            \\n\\n](https://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/cloud-hosted-pbx-maximize-managed-service-provider-opportunity-yeastar/)\\n\\n[\\n\\nUnified Communications\\n\\n                Enhancing Email Governance with Amazon SES            \\n\\n](https://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/enhancing-email-governance-with-amazon-ses-aws/)\\n\\n[\\n\\nUnified Communications\\n\\n                Tollring’s Analytics 365 Lands On PingCo To Elevate Microsoft Teams Voice            \\n\\n](https://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/tollrings-analytics-365-lands-on-pingco-to-elevate-microsoft-teams-voice/)\\n\\n[\\n\\nUnified Communications\\n\\n                Is AI Replacing Human Agents in Contact Centers?

Most commonly, this activity has focused on the AI agent or agent suite — the end product. However, the underlying technologies that power these advances are critical. \\nTo that end, Google has unveiled its latest advancement in supporting development of agentic models. These are models that are adapted to [agentic AI](https://cloudwars.com/innovation-leadership/on-location-at-uipath-forward-ceo-daniel-dines-details-agentic-ai-automation-vision/) tasks with more environmental awareness, foresight, and capabilities for automated actions. Specifically, [Gemini 2.0](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/) is described as an “AI model for the agentic era.” Here’s what to expect. \\n\\n## Gemini 2.0 Flash\\n\\nGoogle has released an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Flash, the first in the Gemini 2.0 model family. “Today we’re excited to launch our next era of models built for this new agentic era: introducing Gemini 2.0, our most capable model yet,” said Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. “With new advances in multimodality — like native image and audio output — and native tool use, it will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.”\\nWith Gemini 2.0 Flash, Google is building on the progress made with 1.5 Flash. In addition to supporting multimodal inputs including images, video, and audio, 2.0 Flash supports multimodal outputs such as natively generated images combined with text and multilingual audio from steerable text-to-speech (TTS).\\nIn terms of how these enhancements can boost the capabilities of agentic AI, Gemini 2.0 Flash boasts:\\n\\n- Native user interface action-capabilities\\n\\n- Multimodal reasoning\\n\\n- Long context understanding\\n\\n- Complex instruction following and planning\\n\\n- Compositional function-calling\\n\\n- Native tool use\\n\\n- Improved performance\\n\\nCollectively, these capabilities enable better agentic AI. Developers can access Gemini 2.0 Flash as an experimental model through the Gemini API in\\xa0Google AI Studio and\\xa0Vertex AI.\\n\\n***[AI Copilot Summit NA](https://copilot.summitna.com/) is an AI-first event to define the opportunities, impact, and outcomes possible with Microsoft Copilot for mid-market & enterprise companies.***** [Register now](https://copilot.summitna.com/register/) to attend AI Copilot Summit in San Diego, CA from March 17-19, 2025. **\\n## General Availability of Trillium\\n\\nGoogle recently announced the general availability of [Trillium](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/trillium-tpu-is-ga), its latest Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Trillium TPUs were instrumental in training Gemini 2.0. They are a key component of Google Cloud’s AI Hypercomputer.\\nWith this availability, Google Cloud customers can now utilize Trillium TPUs to boost their own AI initiatives. “At AI21, we constantly strive to enhance the performance and efficiency of our Mamba and Jamba language models,” said Google Cloud customer Barak Lenz, CTO, AI21 Labs. “As long-time users of TPUs since v4, we’re incredibly impressed with the capabilities of Google Cloud’s Trillium.\\n“The advancements in scale, speed, and cost-efficiency are significant. We believe Trillium will be essential in accelerating the development of our next generation of sophisticated language models, enabling us to deliver even more powerful and accessible AI solutions to our customers.”\\n## Closing Thoughts\\n\\nGoogle has always been recognized as a company that delivers groundbreaking technology advances. The development of Gemini as an infrastructure tool for agentic AI is, in many ways, a logical next step in the company’s journey.\\nArchitectural advancements like this will continue to enable Google to stand out among its competitors. When you consider Google Cloud and the opportunities its [cloud services](https://cloudwars.com/ai/c3-ai-partners-with-aws-to-align-ai-apps-and-cloud-services-for-digital-transformation-apps/) provide in delivering these new solutions, Google has positioned itself strongly in the field of agentic AI.\\n\\n#### Interested in Google Cloud?\\n\\nSchedule a discovery meeting to see if we can help achieve your goals\\n\\n[Connect With Us](javascript:void(0);)\\n\\nClose\\n## Book a Demo\\n\\nName(Required) Email(Required)\\n\\nCompany PhoneInquiry Type(Required)Inquiry typeBook a DemoRequest Discovery CallMessageCAPTCHA\\n\\n[Artificial Intelligence](https://cloudwars.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/) [featured](https://cloudwars.com/tag/featured/) [Google Cloud](https://cloudwars.com/tag/google-cloud/)\\n\\nShare.\\n\\n[\\nFacebook\\n](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcloudwars.com%2Fai%2Fgoogle-launches-new-gemini-model-designed-for-agentic-ai-use-cases%2F)\\n[\\nTwitter\\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloudwars.com%2Fai%2Fgoogle-launches-new-gemini-model-designed-for-agentic-ai-use-cases%2F&text=Google%20Launches%20New%20Gemini%20Model%20Designed%20for%20Agentic%20AI%20Use%20Cases)\\n[\\nLinkedIn\\n](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloudwars.com%2Fai%2Fgoogle-launches-new-gemini-model-designed-for-agentic-ai-use-cases%2F)\\n[\\nEmail\\n](mailto:?subject=Google%20Launches%20New%20Gemini%20Model%20Designed%20for%20Agentic%20AI%20Use%20Cases&body=https%3A%2F%2Fcloudwars.com%2Fai%2Fgoogle-launches-new-gemini-model-designed-for-agentic-ai-use-cases%2F)\\n\\nAnalyst### Kieron Allen\\n\\n###### \\n\\nCloud, AI, InnovationCloud Wars analystMessageFollowing###### Areas of Expertise\\n\\n- Business Apps\\n- Cloud\\n- Cybersecurity\\n- Data\\n\\n- \\n[\\nLinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kieron-allen/)\\n\\nKieron Allen is a Cloud Wars Analyst examining innovations in, and the future impact of, the latest AI, cloud, cybersecurity, and data technology developments.
